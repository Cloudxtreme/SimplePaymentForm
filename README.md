# SimplePaymentForm

Assignment for CZ 3006 - Net-Centric Computing at NTU, Singapore.

This repo implements a simple payment form in HTML, JS & PHP. The user input is validated on client-side using vanilla JavaScript while the server-side form processing & receipt generation is done using PHP. The HTML form takes in the purchase quantities and POSTs it to the server, which adds it to the running totals stored in 'records.txt' and generates a HTML receipt dynamically (using GET parameters) to display to the user.
